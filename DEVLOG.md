### 2025-01-08 - TypeRacer Game Implementation
* Wrote program in client.c that runs TypeRacer in the terminal.
* Wrote comments for readability.
* Problem remains where if the user types a word that is correct, but adds additional characters (ex. "was" & "wasa"), the game will still think it's correct.
* ~ 1.5 hours spent.
