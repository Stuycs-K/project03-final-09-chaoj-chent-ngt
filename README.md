### Project Description:

This project simulates a game where each player has to type each word in a string correctly as fast as possible. 

### Instructions:

How does the user install/compile/run the program.

One machine runs 'make server'.
Other clients that will be playing will run 'make client ARGS=[ip address of server]'.

How does the user interact with this program?

The user will enter their username and type 'ready' when they are ready. Once all users are ready, there will be a countdown. After the countdown, a string will appear on the screen. The user has to type in the underlined word and press enter. The user does this until they reach the end of the string.
